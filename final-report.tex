In a multihop ad hoc network, the interference among nodes is
  reduced to maximize the throughput by using a smallest transmission
  range that still preserve the network connectivity. However, most
  existing works on transmission range control focus on the
  connectivity but lack of results on the throughput performance. This
  paper analyzes the per-node saturated throughput of an IEEE 802.11b
  multihop ad hoc network with a uniform transmission range. Compared
  to simulation, our model can accurately predict the per-node
  throughput.  The results show that the maximum achievable per-node
  throughput can be as low as 11\% of the channel capacity in a normal
  set of $\alpha$ operating parameters independent of node density. However, if
  the network connectivity is considered, the obtainable throughput
  will reduce by as many as 43\% of the maximum throughput.

Generative AI for Traditional Form Converter เป็นโครงการที่จัดทำขึ้นผ่านการพัฒนาผ่านเว็บแอปพลิเคชั่นในชื่อ PaperlessTransform Application
เพื่อแก้ไขปัญหาการใช้ระยะเวลานานในการแปลงแบบฟอร์มกระดาษเป็นรูปแบบเว็บแอปพลิเคชัน โดยการพัฒนาเว็บแอปพลิเคชันนี้ได้มีการใช้ประยุกต์ใช้ปัญญาประดิษฐ์สำหรับการวิเคราะห์เกี่ยวกับประเภทของข้อมูลของคำถาม 
ตามความต้องการที่เพิ่มขึ้นของการแปลงแบบฟอร์ม ดังนั้นนักพัฒนาระบบจึงจำเป็นต้องวิเคราะห์แบบฟอร์มและออกแบบระบบฐานข้อมูลพร้อมทั้งการออกแบบหน้าเว็บแอปพลิเคชัน รวมไปถึงการพัฒนาระบบขึ้นมาใหม่ 
จึงส่งผลให้ต้องใช้ระยะเวลาในการทำงานที่เพิ่มขึ้น นอกจากนี้ นักพัฒนาระบบต้องเผชิญกับปัญหาภาระงานที่มากขึ้น ส่งผลให้บุคคลากรใช้เวลาในการทำงานอย่างไม่มีประสิทธิภาพ 
โดยโครงการของเรามุ่งเน้นการพัฒนาเว็บแอปพลิเคชันที่สามารถแปลงเอกสารในรูปแบบของฟอร์มกระดาษ หรือ ไฟล์อิเล็กทรอนิกส์ให้เป็นรูปแบบของเว็บแอปพลิเคชัน 
โดยใช้เทคนิคการรู้จดจำอักขระด้วยแสงในการแปลงภาพข้อความให้เป็นรูปแบบข้อความเพื่อนำข้อความดังกล่าวจากการแปลงภาพข้อความนำมาประมวลผลในการตรวจจับคำถามในรูปแบบฟอร์ม 
ทางคณะผู้จัดทำโครงการมีการเน้นการพัฒนาเว็บแอปพลิเคชันที่มีความสามารถในการตรวจจับคำถามและความสามารถในการเก็บข้อมูลของเว็บฟอร์ม 
โดยมีวัตถุประสงค์เพื่อลดภาระของนักพัฒนาระบบ โดยผลลัพธ์หลังจากมีการทดลองใช้เว็บแอปพลิเคชั่นดังกล่าวในการทำงานแสดงให้เห็นว่าเว็บแอปพลิเคชันสามารถตรวจจับคำถามในแบบฟอร์มและเก็บข้อมูลได้ในระดับที่น่าพึ่งพอใจ ดังนั้นสรุปได้ว่าโครงการสามารถแก้ไขปัญหาการใช้ระยะเวลาในการทำงานที่เพิ่มขึ้น ของนักพัฒนาระบบได้อย่างมีนัยสำคัญ

\section{Potential Benefits}

COMING SOON NA 



\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item   To reduce the workload and development process for developers. 
\item   To acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for developing an AI-powered web
application
\item To acquire proficiency in utilizing a Large language models and adapt its capabilities to suit the
requirements of this project.
\item  To be the secure all data and form management website
\end{itemize}


\section{Scope of Work}

The scope of this project involves the development of a web application that enables users to upload a PDF or image file. The web application will process text extraction using optical character recognition (OCR). The primary function of the web application includes creating a form, editing a form, deleting a form, and filling a form. The final deliverable of this project will be a responsive web interface web application that allows users to manage the form and view the data, including ensuring data privacy and security measures to protect sensitive information by implementing authentication for the creator and a normal user. The project involves research of optical character recognition (OCR) for the text extraction from the image and the development of generative AI for data type generation, also a Thai language translation to English.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item   What are the problems you are addressing? 
%\item  Why they are important?
%\item  What are the limitations of existing approaches? 
%\end{itemize}

\section{Limitation of Project}
The limitation of the project will addresses a possible constraints and challenges that might affect its scope, execution, or outcomes. the limiting factor are include time, cost and risk etc.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{OCR Accuracy:} The accuracy of OCR text extraction may vary depending on the quality of the uploaded document, such as low-resolution images, poor lighting, and the project does not support handwritten text.
 
    \item \textbf{Language Support:} While the system has the ability to translate text, the accuracy and availability of supported languages may be limited, with the project currently supporting Thai and English form only.
    
    \item \textbf{Required User Reviewing:} After the text extraction and layout detection, the system required a user to review and correct a input label that the system have process. The limitation required of user reviewing because of the lack of OCR accuracy and the system error.
      
    \item \textbf{Data Privacy and Security:} Despite the implementation of verification and security measures, there may still be vulnerabilities related to handling sensitive data, which are continuously checked and updated.
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Schedule}
For the first semester, our project focus on researching and design phase, We have researching all core fundamental concept and define a problem and background of the project. In the design phase, we have design a database design, UX/UI design, architecture design. And this phase also including a Optical Character Recognition proof of concept.

This appendix describes two static allocation methods for fGn (or fBm)
traffic. Here, $\lambda$ and $C$ are respectively the traffic arrival
rate and the service rate per dimensionless time step. Their unit are
converted to a physical time unit by multiplying the step size
$\Delta$. For a fBm self-similar traffic source,
Norros~\cite{norros95} provides its EB as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norros}
  C = \lambda + (\kappa(H)\sqrt{-2\ln\epsilon})^{1/H}a^{1/(2H)}x^{-(1-H)/H}\lambda^{1/(2H)}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa(H) = H^H(1-H)^{(1-H)}$. Simplicity in the calculation is
the attractive feature of (\ref{eq:norros}).

The MVA technique developed in~\cite{kim01} so far provides the most
accurate estimation of the loss probability compared to previous
bandwidth allocation techniques according to simulation results.
Consider a discrete-time queueing system with constant service rate
$C$ and input process $\lambda_n$ with $\mathbb{E}\{\lambda_n\} =
\lambda$ and $\mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\} = \sigma^2$.  Define $X_n \equiv
\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k - Cn$.  The loss probability due to the MVA
approach is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss_mva}
  \varepsilon \approx \alpha e^{-m_x/2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mx}
m_x = \min_{n \geq 0} \frac{((C-\lambda)n + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}} =
\frac{((C-\lambda)n^\ast + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_{n^{\ast}}\}}
\end{equation} 
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha}
  \alpha =
  \frac{1}{\lambda\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(\frac{(C-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
  \int_C^\infty (r-C)\exp\left(\frac{(r-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\, dr
\end{equation}
For a given $\varepsilon$, we numerically solve for $C$ that satisfies
(\ref{eq:loss_mva}). Any search algorithm can be used to do the task.
Here, the bisection method is used.  

Next, we show how $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ can be determined.  Let
$C_{\lambda}(l)$ be the autocovariance function of $\lambda_n$.  The
MVA technique basically approximates the input process $\lambda_n$
with a Gaussian process, which allows $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ to be
represented by the autocovariance function.  In particular, the
variance of $X_n$ can be expressed in terms of $C_{\lambda}(l)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Var}\{X_n\} = nC_{\lambda}(0) + 2\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (n-l)C_{\lambda}(l)
\end{equation} 
Therefore, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ must be known in the MVA technique, either
by assuming specific traffic models or by off-line analysis in case of
traces.  In most practical situations, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ will not be
known in advance, and an on-line measurement algorithm developed
in~\cite{eun01} is required to jointly determine both $n^\ast$ and
$m_x$. For fGn traffic, $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ is equal to $\sigma^2
n^{2H}$, where $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\}$, and we can find
the $n^\ast$ that minimizes (\ref{eq:mx}) directly. Although $\lambda$
can be easily measured, it is not the case for $\sigma^2$ and $H$.
Consequently, the MVA technique suffers from the need of prior
knowledge traffic parameters.

\end{equation} 

\noindent{\large\bf Add more topic as you need} \\

Therefore, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ must be known in the MVA technique, either
