\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Problem Statement} 

Nowadays, there is a shift towards digitalization, whether it is using electronic devices to record instead of using paper or storing data in a database instead of recording on paper. However, there are many things that have not been transformed to be more digital, such as official documents and business documents that are still paper or forms that have been recorded on paper before. For things that have not been developed to be more digital, we are especially interested in improving the filling of paper forms. We found that the steps in the development process that change from paper forms to web forms require developers to analyze forms, create databases, and develop web applications, which takes a lot of time and the number of developers. We see that converting paper forms to digital forms by taking pictures of the forms and the system will create a web form for them. Improving the filling of paper forms to be more digital will help reduce global warming caused by excessive paper use.

\section{Potential Benefits}

\chapter{Background Theory and Related Research}

\section{Introduction and Background}
\subsection{Introduction}
This chapter will explain the details of the core concept and the solution planning. Theory and core concepts, languages and technologies, and related research will be discussed in this chapter. First, we will cover a core concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and image processing etc.. Second, the languages and technologies that we interest in the project including a frontend and backend technology. Lastly, related research and competing solutions that are similar to our project will be in research and competing solutions.

\subsection{Background}
The digital transformation of businesses has been accelerated by the need for faster, more reliable ways to handle data. Although many organizations have begun to adopt digital processes, a significant number still rely on paper forms, which can slow down operations and increase the risk of errors. Manual data entry, in particular, is an inefficient method that often leads to mistakes, misinterpretations, and lost time. \par
To solve these problems, many organizations are looking for ways to turn paper forms into digital formats automatically. This is where AI comes in. AI tools can be trained to read forms and convert them into digital versions, speeding up the process and reducing errors. By automating this task, businesses can save time, lower costs, and reduce mistakes, allowing employees to focus on more important tasks.\par
This chapter will explain the main ideas behind the project. It will also discuss the technologies used in the project and look at similar research in the field of form automation.

\section{Theory and Core Concepts}
\subsection{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the study and development of intelligent machines and software that can reason, learn, communicate, and perceive objects, aiming to mimic human-like behavior. Coined by John McCarthy in 1956, AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

\subsection{Machine Learning (ML)}
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is crucial in building systems that can automatically learn to recognize patterns and improve over time with more data.

\textbf{Machine Learning Method:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supervised Learning:} A type of machine learning where the model is trained using a labeled dataset. This means the data comes with answers, so the model learns to make predictions or classify information correctly.
 
    \item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning:} A type of machine learning where the computer learns from data without labels or answers. Instead of being told what to look for, the model tries to find patterns or group similar data points together on its own.
    
    \item \textbf{Semi-supervised learning:} Like a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data (with answers) and a large amount of unlabeled data (without answers) to train the model. The labeled data helps guide the model, while the unlabeled data helps it find patterns and improve accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computer Vision (CV)}
Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that uses machine learning to enable computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It combines different methods and technologies. \par
Key functions of computer vision include analyzing images and videos to extract important information, understanding events and descriptions, and identifying patterns in scenery. CV employs methods that handle large volumes of data, making it applicable across various domains.

\subsection{Image Processing}
Image processing is the one technique in \textbf{Computer Vision (CV)} that is used to enhance and prepare images for analysis by applying various computational algorithms. In the context of form conversion, image processing plays a critical role in improving the quality of scanned documents or digital images before they undergo text recognition.

\subsubsection{Image Acquisition:} \noindent The first step in image processing is acquiring the image, where an image is captured using a camera, scanner, or another device. Then the image is converted into a digital format that can be manipulated by algorithms.

This appendix describes two static allocation methods for fGn (or fBm)
traffic. Here, $\lambda$ and $C$ are respectively the traffic arrival
rate and the service rate per dimensionless time step. Their unit are
converted to a physical time unit by multiplying the step size
$\Delta$. For a fBm self-similar traffic source,
Norros~\cite{norros95} provides its EB as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norros}
  C = \lambda + (\kappa(H)\sqrt{-2\ln\epsilon})^{1/H}a^{1/(2H)}x^{-(1-H)/H}\lambda^{1/(2H)}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa(H) = H^H(1-H)^{(1-H)}$. Simplicity in the calculation is
the attractive feature of (\ref{eq:norros}).

The MVA technique developed in~\cite{kim01} so far provides the most
accurate estimation of the loss probability compared to previous
bandwidth allocation techniques according to simulation results.
Consider a discrete-time queueing system with constant service rate
$C$ and input process $\lambda_n$ with $\mathbb{E}\{\lambda_n\} =
\lambda$ and $\mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\} = \sigma^2$.  Define $X_n \equiv
\sum_{k=1}^n \lambda_k - Cn$.  The loss probability due to the MVA
approach is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss_mva}
  \varepsilon \approx \alpha e^{-m_x/2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mx}
m_x = \min_{n \geq 0} \frac{((C-\lambda)n + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}} =
\frac{((C-\lambda)n^\ast + B)^2}{\mathrm{Var}\{X_{n^{\ast}}\}}
\end{equation} 
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:alpha}
  \alpha =
  \frac{1}{\lambda\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left(\frac{(C-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
  \int_C^\infty (r-C)\exp\left(\frac{(r-\lambda)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\, dr
\end{equation}
For a given $\varepsilon$, we numerically solve for $C$ that satisfies
(\ref{eq:loss_mva}). Any search algorithm can be used to do the task.
Here, the bisection method is used.  

Next, we show how $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ can be determined.  Let
$C_{\lambda}(l)$ be the autocovariance function of $\lambda_n$.  The
MVA technique basically approximates the input process $\lambda_n$
with a Gaussian process, which allows $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ to be
represented by the autocovariance function.  In particular, the
variance of $X_n$ can be expressed in terms of $C_{\lambda}(l)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Var}\{X_n\} = nC_{\lambda}(0) + 2\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (n-l)C_{\lambda}(l)
\end{equation} 
Therefore, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ must be known in the MVA technique, either
by assuming specific traffic models or by off-line analysis in case of
traces.  In most practical situations, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ will not be
known in advance, and an on-line measurement algorithm developed
in~\cite{eun01} is required to jointly determine both $n^\ast$ and
$m_x$. For fGn traffic, $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ is equal to $\sigma^2
n^{2H}$, where $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\}$, and we can find
the $n^\ast$ that minimizes (\ref{eq:mx}) directly. Although $\lambda$
can be easily measured, it is not the case for $\sigma^2$ and $H$.
Consequently, the MVA technique suffers from the need of prior
knowledge traffic parameters.

Next, we show how $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ can be determined.  Let
$C_{\lambda}(l)$ be the autocovariance function of $\lambda_n$.  The
MVA technique basically approximates the input process $\lambda_n$
with a Gaussian process, which allows $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ to be
represented by the autocovariance function.  In particular, the
variance of $X_n$ can be expressed in terms of $C_{\lambda}(l)$ as
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{Var}\{X_n\} = nC_{\lambda}(0) + 2\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (n-l)C_{\lambda}(l)
\end{equation} 

\noindent{\large\bf Add more topic as you need} \\

Therefore, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ must be known in the MVA technique, either
by assuming specific traffic models or by off-line analysis in case of
traces.  In most practical situations, $C_{\lambda}(l)$ will not be
known in advance, and an on-line measurement algorithm developed
in~\cite{eun01} is required to jointly determine both $n^\ast$ and
$m_x$. For fGn traffic, $\mathrm{Var}\{X_n\}$ is equal to $\sigma^2
n^{2H}$, where $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{Var}\{\lambda_n\}$, and we can find
the $n^\ast$ that minimizes (\ref{eq:mx}) directly. Although $\lambda$
can be easily measured, it is not the case for $\sigma^2$ and $H$.
Consequently, the MVA technique suffers from the need of prior
knowledge traffic parameters.
