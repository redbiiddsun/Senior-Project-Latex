\setlength{\parindent}{15pt} The Generative AI for Traditional Form Converter is a project developed through a web application called PaperlessTransform Application, aimed at solving the problem of time-consuming processes involved in converting PDF forms into web applications. This web application leverages artificial intelligence to analyze data types of input labels. As the demand for form conversion continues to increase, system developers are required to analyze a PDF forms structure, design corresponding database structures, create web application interfaces, and develop new systems. These tasks result in significantly increased work time and workload, causing personnel to spend time inefficiently. The goal of this project is to reduce the burden on system developers by automating parts of this workflow. The application is designed to process a PDF file, detect an input fields using parser,  generate an input field data type using AI-powered text analysis, and generate web-based forms accordingly. In addition to form field detection, the system can store form data in a structured format suitable for web deployment, enabling a smoother transition from traditional documents to digital interfaces. The project team has focused on developing a robust system that not only identifies relevant form elements accurately but also simplifies the data handling and form creation process. After testing the web application, results show that it can detect input field within forms and store data at a basic level, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Therefore, it can be concluded that this project addresses the problem of increased work time and inefficiency for system developers, offering an effective tool for automated form conversion and reducing the manual effort required in digitizing traditional forms.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Problem Statement} 

In recent year, the world has become more digitized than ever, whether it be using electronic devices for note-taking instead of paper or storing a data in a database rather than use a paper documentation, However, there are still many aspects that have not been transform to be a digital, such as a government organization that still rely on paper documentation or  the data forms that have been previously recorded on paper. However, for those that have not been developed to be digital, we were motivated to improve the efficiency of form filling. And we found that the development process from paper-based forms to web forms required developers to do an analysis of the form, create a database, and develop a front-end and backend system. Which causes a developer time to spend and resources of developers. We acknowledge this difficulty and offer a solution that converts paper forms into web form ones so that the system can automatically create a web form by just taking a picture of the form. By decreasing excessive paper use, this development in digitizing form-filling procedures will not only increase efficiency but also lessen the environmental impact and help to slow down global warming.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item   To reduce the workload and development process for developers. 
\item   To acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for developing an AI-powered web
application
\item To acquire proficiency in utilizing a Large language models and adapt its capabilities to suit the
requirements of this project.
\item  To be the secure all data and form management website
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope of Work}

The scope of this project involves the development of a web application that enables users to upload a PDF file. The web application will process text extraction using technique called pdf parsing. The primary function of the web application includes creating a form, editing a form, deleting a form, and filling a form. The final deliverable of this project will be a web application that allows users to manage the form and view the data, including ensuring data privacy and security measures to protect sensitive information by implementing authentication for the creator and a normal user. The project involves research of text parser for extract a input label from a pdf text and the development of generative AI for data type generation, also a Thai language translation to English.
%\begin{itemize}

%\item  Why they are important?
%\item  What are the limitations of existing approaches? 
%\end{itemize}

\section{Limitation of Project}
The limitation of the project will addresses a possible constraints and challenges that might affect its scope, execution, or outcomes. the limiting factor are include time, cost and risk etc.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{PDF Support:} The project supports text-based PDFs but not image-based ones. Text within scanned documents cannot be extracted due to the lack of OCR support. Additionally, some PDFs may fail during text extraction because they are compressed or contain missing characters.
  
    \item \textbf{Language Support:} While the system has the ability to translate text, the accuracy and availability of supported languages may be limited, with the project currently supporting Thai and English form only.
    
    \item \textbf{Required User Reviewing:} After text extraction and layout detection, the system requires users to review and correct the input labels it processed. This limitation exists due to text extraction accuracy and generative AI accuracy.
      
    \item \textbf{Data Privacy and Security:} Despite the implementation of verification and security measures, there may still be vulnerabilities related to handling sensitive data, which are continuously checked and updated.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Background Theory and Related Research}

\section{Introduction and Background}
\subsection{Introduction}
This chapter will explain the details of the core concept and the solution planning. Theory and core concepts, languages and technologies, and related research will be discussed in this chapter. First, we will cover a core concept of artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing and image processing etc.. Second, the languages and technologies that we interest in the project including a frontend and backend technology. Lastly, related research and competing solutions that are similar to our project will be in research and competing solutions.

\subsection{Background}
The digital transformation of businesses has been accelerated by the need for faster, more reliable ways to handle data. Although many organizations have begun to adopt digital processes, a significant number still rely on paper forms, which can slow down operations and increase the risk of errors. Manual data entry, in particular, is an inefficient method that often leads to mistakes, misinterpretations, and lost time. \par
To solve these problems, many organizations are looking for ways to turn paper forms into digital formats automatically. This is where AI comes in. AI tools can be trained to read forms and convert them into digital versions, speeding up the process and reducing errors. By automating this task, businesses can save time, lower costs, and reduce mistakes, allowing employees to focus on more important tasks.\par
This chapter will explain the main ideas behind the project. It will also discuss the technologies used in the project and look at similar research in the field of form automation.

\section{Theory and Core Concepts}
\subsection{Artificial Intelligence (AI)}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the study and development of intelligent machines and software that can reason, learn, communicate, and perceive objects, aiming to mimic human-like behavior. Coined by John McCarthy in 1956, AI is a branch of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

\subsection{Machine Learning (ML)}
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is crucial in building systems that can automatically learn to recognize patterns and improve over time with more data.

\textbf{Machine Learning Method:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supervised Learning:} A type of machine learning where the model is trained using a labeled dataset. This means the data comes with answers, so the model learns to make predictions or classify information correctly.
 
    \item \textbf{Unsupervised Learning:} A type of machine learning where the computer learns from data without labels or answers. Instead of being told what to look for, the model tries to find patterns or group similar data points together on its own.
    
    \item \textbf{Semi-supervised learning:} Like a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data (with answers) and a large amount of unlabeled data (without answers) to train the model. The labeled data helps guide the model, while the unlabeled data helps it find patterns and improve accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computer Vision (CV)}
Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that uses machine learning to enable computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos. It combines different methods and technologies. \par
Key functions of computer vision include analyzing images and videos to extract important information, understanding events and descriptions, and identifying patterns in scenery. CV employs methods that handle large volumes of data, making it applicable across various domains.

\subsection{Image Processing}
Image processing is the one technique in \textbf{Computer Vision (CV)} that is used to enhance and prepare images for analysis by applying various computational algorithms. In the context of form conversion, image processing plays a critical role in improving the quality of scanned documents or digital images before they undergo text recognition.

\subsubsection{Image Acquisition} The first step in image processing is acquiring the image, where an image is captured using a camera, scanner, or another device. Then the image is converted into a digital format that can be manipulated by algorithms.

\subsubsection{Preprocessing} Preprocessing is a fundamental step where the raw image quality is improved to ensure it is ready for more advanced analysis. This involves techniques such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Image Enhancement:}  Image enhancement involves using techniques to improve the visual quality of an image so that important features are more visible. This is especially important when working with scanned documents or photos that may have different lighting conditions, colors, or other visual characteristics that could obscure the text. Here are some common techniques used for image enhancement:
	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item \textbf{Grayscale Conversion}
    		\item \textbf{Histogram Equalization}
   		 \item \textbf{Thresholding}
   		 \item \textbf{Contrast Adjustment}
	\end{enumerate}
 
    \item \textbf{Image Restoration:} The Image Restoration process aims to improve the appearance of an image by fixing problems like noise and blurriness. It uses mathematical models to understand how the image got damaged and applies techniques to clean it up. Common techniques involved in image restoration include Noise Reduction and Blur removal 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Segmentation} The main goal of image segmentation is to divide an image into distinct parts that match real objects or areas in the picture. This process separates important pixels from the rest of the image, resulting in sections that cover the entire image or outlines of objects.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=10cm]{./assets/segmentation.jpg}
    \caption{Image Segmentation Explained from 
    \href{https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/1_image-segmentation\%202.jpeg}{Builtin.com}.}
    \label{fig:figure-2.1}  
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Original image
    \item[(b)] Semantic Segmentation
    \item[(c)] Instance Segmentation
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Feature Extraction} Once the image has been segmented, the next step is to extract  features that can be used for further analysis, such as character recognition or form field identification. Feature extraction techniques identify important attributes such as: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Color Image Processing:} Color image processing is classified into two types:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Full-color processing:}involves images captured using full-color sensors, further divided into:
			\begin{enumerate}
			    	\item Individual Component Processing: Each color component (like RGB) is processed separately before creating a composite image.
			    	\item Direct Color Pixel Manipulation: Color pixels are manipulated directly.
			\end{enumerate}
	    	\item \textbf{Pseudo-color processing:} assigns colors to specific gray values based on criteria, utilizing techniques like intensity slicing and color coding.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Image Compression:} Image compression reduces the amount of information needed to represent a digital image, primarily to save storage space or reduce bandwidth during transmission. It is categorized into two types:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    	\item \textbf{Lossless Compression:} No information is lost during compression.
	    	\item \textbf{Lossy Compression:} Accepts some loss of information for higher compression rates.
	\end{enumerate}
	\newpage %%%ขึ้นหน้าใหม่%%%
	\item \textbf{Morphological Image Processing:} This technique focuses on extracting and analyzing the shape and structure of objects within an image. Common morphological operators include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Boundary extraction
		\item Region filling
		\item Skeletonization
		\item Extraction of connected components
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Representation and Description:} Post-segmentation, raw pixel data needs to be compacted for further analysis. Representation techniques can focus on external features (like boundaries) or internal features (like pixels covering the region). Common methods include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Chain Codes and Polygonal Approximations:} representing shapes.
		\item \textbf{Boundary Descriptors:} Include features like length, diameter, and curvature.
		\item \textbf{Regional Descriptors:} Describe image regions in terms of area, compactness, gray level statistics, and topological features.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Object Recognition} Object recognition is the process of identifying and classifying different regions in an image, referred to as patterns or objects. There are two main approaches to object recognition

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Decision-Theoretic Approach:} This method uses numerical descriptions to analyze patterns. It looks at measurable features.
	\item \textbf{Structural Approach:} This approach focuses on qualitative descriptions, using relational descriptors that describe the relationships and arrangements between different parts of the patterns.
\end{enumerate}
 
\subsection{Optical Character Recognition (OCR)} OCR or Optical Character Recognition is an input device used to read a printed text. OCR scans text in image, analyzes it character by character and converts it into machine-readable code and stores text on the system memory and processes it as a document. OCR is widely used in applications where transforming printed material into editable text.

\subsubsection{OCR Architecture} After \textbf{image processing}, OCR comes into play. It extracts the text from the processed images, analyzing the document character by character to convert it into machine-readable code. It converts printed or handwritten text from forms into digital text, which can then be manipulated and stored. Once OCR extracts the raw text, \textbf{text processing} helps clean, format, and analyze this text.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{./assets/OCR-Process.png}
\caption{OCR Process}
\caption{OCR Process from 
\href{https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian-Gomez-9/publication/281099638/figure/fig4/AS:614266293997575@1523463905255/Architecture-diagram-for-the-OCR-alternative.png}{Researchgate.net}.}
\label{fig:figure-2.2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Post OCR error correction} After Extract the text from the image, The OCR are required a post OCR error correction because the text that the OCR have extracted may not misspelling and character miss order and the post OCR have following approach.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction:} Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction is works by generating possible corrections for misspelled words using a deletion-based algorithm. First, a precomputed dictionary is built by selecting valid words and generating variations with up to N deleted characters. These variations function as keys, leading back to the correct words. When a user types a misspelled word, the algorithm generates similar deletions and looks for matches in the precomputed dictionary. If a match is found, the appropriate word is suggested.
\newpage %%%ขึ้นหน้าใหม่%%%	
	\item \textbf{TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:} TF-IDF is a technique that use to change a word into number or vector and the cosine similarity is a technique that use to measure how similar between two documents, and we will use a dictionary and convert it into vector, then compare with error word and find the closest distance.
	
\[
\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = \text{TF}(t, d) \times \text{IDF}(t)
\]
	
\[
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i B_i}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i^2} \times \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} B_i^2}}
\]

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Natural Language Processing (NLP)} Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. The process involves several key techniques: Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units (tokens), such as words or phrases, which can be analyzed separately. Stop Word Removal: Eliminates common words that provide little informational value, focusing on more meaningful words. Lemmatization and Stemming: Reduces words to their root forms to unify different inflected versions (e.g., "walking" becomes "walk"). Part-of-Speech Tagging: Assigns tags to words based on their grammatical roles (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).

\subsection{Deep Learning} Deep Learning is a type of machine learning where computers are trained to think and learn like humans by processing large amounts of data. It uses a special kind of program called a neural network, which is inspired by the way our brains work. These networks can figure out patterns and make decisions on their own, such as recognizing faces in photos, translating languages, or even predicting what you might want to buy.

\begin{figure}[H]

\href{https://www.qtravel.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sieci-neuronowe-grafika-768x570.png}{Qtravel.ai}.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generative AI} Generative AI refers to deep learning models that can generate high-quality text, images, and other content based on trained data.  It works by analyzing a lot of data, such as Wikipedia articles or famous paintings, and then using what it learns to produce original outputs similar to the data it studied. \par
In the past, AI models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) helped create realistic images and sounds. Now, newer models like transformers have taken over. Transformers are powerful because they can learn from massive amounts of text without needing people to label everything.

\subsubsection{Types of Transformer models}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Encoder-only models} (such as BERT): Great for understanding and categorizing text but not for generating new content.
	\item \textbf{Decoder-only models} (such as GPT): Focus on predicting the next word and are good at creating new text.
	\item \textbf{Encoder-decoder models} (such as T5): Combine both approaches and can handle tasks like summarizing or translating text.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Security of Web Form} Web form security is essential as these forms are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, making them prime targets for malicious parties aiming to access sensitive user data. 
Common threats include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):} Attackers inject malicious scripts into web forms or application code, which can steal user information like keystrokes or cookies, or redirect users to harmful websites.
	\item \textbf{SQL Injection:} Attackers manipulate SQL code within web forms to access or alter databases. This technique can expose or modify sensitive data, and it’s one of the oldest and most dangerous web vulnerabilities.
	\item \textbf{Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):} Attackers trick users into performing unintended actions, such as submitting forms or transferring data, without their knowledge. These attacks exploit the user’s browser and session data.
	\item \textbf{Data Breaches:} A variety of attacks can lead to breaches, exposing sensitive customer information and damaging a business's reputation, as users lose trust in the website's security.
\end{enumerate}

	Many data privacy laws now regulate how web applications must ensure security, especially when handling personal information. The rules we must follow may depend on where our business is located and how it operates. To stay compliant, website owners need to adopt secure practices for web forms.

\textbf{Key laws to be aware of}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)}
	\item \textbf{CCPA, CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act)}
	\item \textbf{HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)}
	\item \textbf{PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)}
\end{enumerate}
\newpage %%%ขึ้นหน้าใหม่%%%
\textbf{Key measures for securing web forms}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Use TLS/SSL Certificates:} TLS/SSL certificates create encrypted links between browsers and servers, ensuring that data transferred is protected. Extended Validation (EV) certificates provide the highest level of security.
	\item \textbf{Encrypt Data:} End-to-end encryption (E2EE) ensures that data is protected throughout its journey from sender to recipient, preventing unauthorized access. Use SSL certificates and CDNs to enhance security.
	\item \textbf{Validate and Sanitize Input:} Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injections or cross-site scripting (XSS). Validation checks if inputs are correct, while sanitization removes harmful data.
	\item \textbf{Collect Minimal Data:} Only collect necessary information to reduce the impact of potential data breaches. This minimizes risk and aligns with privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
	\item \textbf{Anonymize Data:} Mask sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) using techniques like asterisks or data shuffling, making it harder for attackers to misuse it.
	\item \textbf{Ask for Consent:} Obtain clear user consent before collecting personal data, and provide easy access to your privacy policy outlining how data is used and protected.
	\item \textbf{Restrict File Uploads:} Limit file uploads by allowing only authorized users, setting file size limits, and using whitelist file types to prevent malware.
	\item \textbf{Use reCAPTCHA:} Implement reCAPTCHA to differentiate between humans and bots, helping reduce spam and prevent automated attacks.
	\item \textbf{Require Authentication:} For sensitive forms, require users to authenticate (e.g., through login or multi-factor authentication) to restrict access to authorized individuals only.
	\item \textbf{Use Virus and Malware Protection:} Employ virus and malware protection through layered security, such as firewalls, malware scans, and intrusion detection, to safeguard your web forms from threats.
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Llama 3.2} is a generative AI from Facebook
\end{itemize}


\section{System Worflow}

\subsection{Extracting text and text parse}

\subsubsection{Extracting text}

Text extraction is the first step after a user uploads a file through the web application. In this stage, a PDF library such as PyMuPDF or pdfplumber is used to extract both the text and layout from the PDF. This is followed by text preprocessing to prepare the content for analysis such as normalizing special dot characters to standard dots to ensure accurate parsing during the next phase.

\subsubsection{Text Parse}

Text parsing is the second process after the extracted text has been completed. Text parse is the process of analyzing a text and breaking down the text to convert it into a structured format, In this process, the purpose of text parse is to analyze the layout of the form, by using a text from a previous process to identify where which text is the label of the input field. The text parse algorithm starts by separating the text from each line and analyzing it line by line, If there is a word in front of the small point the text parse will mark the text as an input label, but if the line starts with the small point the parse will look back to the previous line to check whether if there any text that matches with the condition that parse has.

%\subsubsection{Text Error Correction}

%Text Error Correction is the third process after extracting text and text parse, respectively. Text error correction is identifying and fixing errors in a given text. Text error correction includes spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, punctuation issues, and incorrect word usage. In this process, the text error correction focuses on spelling mistakes and vowel missed order, To make a correction, the first step is to tokenize the whole word into a single word and check the word with a dictionary, If the word does not exist then the system will mark it as an error like this "<ERROR>Wolrd</ERROR>". The system will correct the word with a cosine similarity technique, the technique will convert a dictionary into a vector and also an error text. It will rank with cosine similarity, then it will take the first rank to replace a text. This process is required only for the user who uploads an image.

\subsection{AI Model}

\subsubsection{Translation}

Translation is the fourth process and the first process that AI have involve in the project. Translation is the process of  translate a Thai text to English text by using No Language Left Behind (NLLB) from meta, which the model is aim for high-quality translations directly between 200 languages. And we have selected a fine-tuned version of NLLB, which is wtarit/nllb-600M-th-en model and use it via hugging face transformer.

\subsubsection{Data Type Generator}

The Data Type Generator is the fifth process after preparing the process before the data type generator. The Data type generator is designed to generate a suitable datatype of each input field, for example, birthdate must be Date instead of string, passport number must be string, or text instead of number. All of these types will be applied with the form schema to make a form able to validate a correct data input. The data type generator is going to use a Llama 3 for prompt and generate a schema, and it will use an ollama as an interface for connecting to and communicating with the Llama 3 local model.

\subsection{Form Schema Generator}

The Form Schema Generator is the last process of the flow, the form schema generator will be used to generate a form schema from the output received from the data type generator to show output on the webpage and interact with the user.

\chapter{Implementation Result}

This chapter will cover all the working process and implementation progress of our project. also address problems that are challenging. And we will divided each topic by features

\section{Paper-Based Form Analysis System}

The Paper-Based Form Analysis System is mainly focused on extracting a text from the image or file, and analyzing a form layout to identify an input label in the text, also the translation part and data type generator by using generative AI.

\subsection{Text Extraction Feature}
The Text Extraction we have separate into 2 major components which is extraction from image and extraction from PDF. Both of them were implemented already, but there are a problem with the extract text from image because we have use optical character recognition technique and Figure \ref{fig:ocr-result} is a result of the extraction from image, which  contains multiple OCR inaccuracies that affect the readability and accuracy of the extracted text.Character recognition errors are present, where the letter, number and special character are misidentified, such as confusing "O" with "0" or "I" with "1,". And the extraction from PDF is using a PyPlumber to extract text, and the result is working correctly as Figure \ref{fig:pdf-result}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 10cm]{./assets/pdf-extract.png}}
\caption{PDF Text Extraction Result}\label{fig:pdf-result}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Form Parse}
The Form Parse is implemented to identify an input label of the form and separate a form title. we have tested a several form and the result of form parse was 
great but there are some minor defects, if the extracted text does not match with the pattern algorithm that we design, so some labels may be missing.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\fbox{\includegraphics[width= 10cm]{./assets/form-parse.png}}
\caption{Form Parse Result}\label{fig:Form-Parse}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Translation Thai to English}
The Translation is use to translate a Thai language input label to english. we have use a NLLB-200 fined tuned model. Figure \ref{fig:trans-result} below show that the translation is working correctly but may not it may get a text that we expect, such as \textthai{วันเกิด} expected value to be Date of Birth, but the predicted result show "Birthdate". which it have ability to translate into a correct meaning.
